## Projects:
**1. Supervised Machine Learning**
   - **Skills & Tools Covered:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifiers, KNN classification
   - **Project link:** [Supervised Machine Learning](https://nbviewer.org/github/nanditashukla/AIML-Projects/blob/main/01_Supervised%20Machine%20Learning/PROJECT_1.ipynb)
   - **Project Topic:** Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
   - Built Supervised Learning Classification models to help identify potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. Compared models built with Logistic Regression, KNN algorithm and Naive Bayes in order to select the best performing one.
          
**2. Unsupervised Machine Learning**
   - Covers K-means clustering, High-dimensional clustering, Hierarchical clustering, Dimension Reduction-PCA4
      - **Project link:** [Unsupervised Learning](https://nbviewer.org/github/nanditashukla/AIML-Projects/blob/main/02_Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning/PROJECT_2.ipynb)
         - Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification

**3. Ensemble Methods**
   - Covers Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting
      - **Project link:** [Ensemble Technique](https://nbviewer.org/github/nanditashukla/AIML-Projects/blob/main/03_Ensemble%20Methods/Project_1.ipynb)
         - Leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not. Different classification algorithms like Decision tree, Logistic Regression were used. Ensemble techniques like Random forest were used to further improve the classification results.

**4. Feature Engineering Techniques**
   - Covers Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Exploration and Selection Techniques, Hyperparameter Tuning
      - **Project link:** [Feature Engineering Techniques](https://nbviewer.org/github/nanditashukla/AIML-Projects/blob/main/04_Feature%20Engineering%20Techniques/project_2.ipynb)
        - Used feature exploration and selection technique to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used regression models like decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and grid search were used to tune the parameters for the best model performance.

**5. Neural Networks**
   - Covers Gradient Descent, Batch Normalization, Hyper parameter tuning, Tensor Flow & Keras for Neural Networks & Deep Learning, Introduction to Perceptron & Neural Networks, Activation and Loss functions, Deep Neural Networks
      - **Project link:** [Neural Networks](https://nbviewer.org/github/nanditashukla/AIML-Projects/blob/main/05_Neural%20Networks/Nandita_DL_Project_1.ipynb)
        - SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network
